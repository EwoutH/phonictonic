# Phonic Tonic - Audio to Text Transcription Service

[Phonic Tonic Website - Live Demo](https://phonictonic.com/)

In this three part episode series, we will be building an end to end, state of the art, online audio transcription service. Here are episodes [Phonic Tonic Proof of Concept (1/3)](https://sysadmincasts.com/episodes/65-phonic-tonic-proof-of-concept-1-3), [Phonic Tonic - Building a Prototype (2/3) (screencast)](https://sysadmincasts.com/episodes/66-phonic-tonic-building-a-prototype-2-3), and part 3/3 is still pending. This is a container education project where to walk through a real life app.

To understand this, you should probably checkout episode on [Kubernetes General Explanation](https://sysadmincasts.com/episodes/56-kubernetes-general-explanation), [Simple Deployment Pipeline](https://sysadmincasts.com/episodes/58-simple-deployment-pipeline), and [Fun with RabbitMQ](https://sysadmincasts.com/episodes/59-fun-with-rabbitmq).

We will walk through fixing these issues together over the next few episodes:

* hardcoded mysql password (k8s secrets)
* hardcoded admin ip (k8s env)
* hardcoded rabbitmq password & ip address (k8s env)
* hardcoded project names (k8s env)
* hardcoded storage bucket (k8s env)
* no monitoring, logging, or alerting (devops tooling)
* needs cache (arch planning, load testing, redis, etc)
